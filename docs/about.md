## Welcome to ReCoDE! 

ReCoDE is a collection of high-quality research computing and data science exemplars with learning annotation. It is a pilot project coordinated by the [Graduate School Research Computing and Data Science (RCDS)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/graduate-school/students/doctoral/professional-development/research-computing-data-science/) team that is funded by the [Imperial Excellence Fund for Learning and Teaching Innovation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/leadership-and-strategy/provost/vice-provost-education/the-excellence-fund-for-learning-and-teaching-innovation/). 

### Aim
So far, ReCoDE has gathered a small set of exemplars of high-quality research computing and data science projects from various disciplines. The exemplars demonstrate research software best practices and various tacit skills essential to managing a larger computational science project. We have started with a trial group of five projects and aim to extend this with an additional 35 exemplars, subject to further funding.

### ReCoDE exemplars:
* Are developed by students for students and the research community.
* Solve representative disciplinary problems that will help students bridge the gap between the Graduate Schoolâ€™s RCDS courses and their own research projects.
* Provide both a learning and teaching resource. The code and documentation are enriched with details outlining stepwise development and organisational decisions. Each step starts with the author's rationale and design strategy. Annotations are presented in engaging ways including text, images and storyboards.
* Demonstrate software engineering best practices - each exemplar was developed in collaboration with [Imperial's Research Software Engineering team](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/research-software-engineering/).
* Are substantial enough to demonstrate a solution to a significant problem, but concise enough to be digestible.
