# Implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Ising model

**Markov Chain Monte Carlo to showcase best practices in developing scientific software, developed by Tom Hodson.**

## About

This is an exemplar project designed to showcase best practices in developing scientific software as part of the ReCoDE Project at Imperial College London.

**You do not need to know or care about Markov Chain Monte Carlo for this to be useful to you.**

Rather this project is primarily designed to showcase the tools and practices available to you when developing scientific software projects. Maybe you are a PhD student just starting, or a researcher just about to embark on a larger scale software project - there should be something interesting here for you. Designed by [Tom Hodson](https://github.com/TomHodson/).
