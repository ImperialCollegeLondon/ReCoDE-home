## Welcome to ReCoDE - Research Computing and Data Science Exemplars for Learning

**Reasonably-sized research computing exemplars with rich learning annotation for doctoral students and researchers who are embarking on a project with a significant computational aspects.**

Study various design decisions, good sofware engineering practice, scaling up with high performace computing, and many other skills needed to make a transition from learning in a classroom to working independently on your own project. Research computing practice is the main focus, scientific aspects of all exemplars are accessible to most.

The resource was created by PhD students in collaboration with teaching staff and research software engineers.
