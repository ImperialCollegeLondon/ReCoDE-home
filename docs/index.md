<h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to ReCoDE - Research Computing and Data Science Exemplars for Learning and Teaching</h1>

**A set of research computing exemplars with rich learning annotation for doctoral students and researchers who are working on projects with significant computational aspects.**

Explore technical design decisions, good sofware engineering practices and scale up your research with High Performance Computing. Learn a range of other skills needed to make a transition from theoretical learning to applying technical knowledge to your own project. Research computing practice is the main focus, scientific aspects in all exemplars are intended to be accessible to all.

This resource was created by PhD students in collaboration with [StudentShapers](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/studentshapers/), teaching staff and [Research Software Engineers](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/research-software-engineering/).

Get started with our [Exemplars](exemplars/index.md).
