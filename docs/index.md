## Welcome to ReCoDE! 

Research Computing and Data Science Exemplars (ReCODE) project is a collection of high-quality research computing and data science exemplars. It is a pilot project from [Graduate School Research Computing and Data Science (RCDS)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/graduate-school/students/doctoral/professional-development/research-computing-data-science/) team and is funded by the [Imperial Excellence Fund for Learning and Teaching innovation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/leadership-and-strategy/provost/vice-provost-education/the-excellence-fund-for-learning-and-teaching-innovation/). 

### Aim
The ReCoDE project (Research Computing and Data Science Exemplars) aims to gather exemplars of high-quality research computing and data science projects from various disciplines that demonstrate the use of research software best practices. We are starting with a five-project pilot. If successful, the ReCoDE pilot will be funded for additional 35 exemplars.

__ReCoDE exemplars will__:

* Solve representative disciplinary problems that will help students bridge the gap between the Graduate Schoolâ€™s RCDS courses and embarking on their own research projects with substantial code development aspects.
* Serve primarily as a learning resource. The code and documentation will be enriched with details outlining stepwise development and organisational decisions. Each step will start with the author's rationale, design strategy, and references to other problems that utilise a similar approach. The annotation will be presented in engaging ways including text, videos, storyboards, and other media.
* Be developed according to research software engineering best practices.
* Typically, be around 500-1000 lines long, although this is not a hard limit. Exemplars are long enough to demonstrate a solution to a significant problem, but short enough to be digestible and to be realised in the time frame of the project (including accompanying annotations).
