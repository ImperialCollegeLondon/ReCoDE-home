<h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to ReCoDE - Research Computing and Data Science Exemplars for Learning and Teaching</h1>

**A set of research computing exemplars with rich learning annotation for doctoral students and researchers who are working on projects with significant computational aspects.**

ReCoDE exemplars will enable you to:

* Examine project organisation
* Explore technical design decisions
* Study good sofware engineering practices 
* Grasp scaling up with High Performance Computing 
* Learn a range of skills essential to make a transition from theory to practice

This resource was created by doctoral students, [StudentShapers](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/studentshapers/) in collaboration with staff from the [Graduate School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/graduate-school/) and [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), and [Research Software Engineers](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/research-software-engineering/).
