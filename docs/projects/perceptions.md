# End-to-end training of a deep learning model

**pyTorch implementation of a deep convolutional neural network model trained on Places365 data, developed by Emily Muller.**

## About

This model is trained on a subset of 100K images which have outcome labels that are associated to factors which are relevant for environmental health.

In this project, we will cover the foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition tasks.

### Learning Objectives
- Be aware of different types of Computer Vision tasks
- Load an image dataset in PyTorch
- Be able to explain what a convolutional layer does and how it's different from a fully-connected layer
- Identify different components of a CNN
- Load a pre-trained model in PyTorch
- Be able to use PyTorch to train a model on a dataset
- Iterate on design choices for model training
