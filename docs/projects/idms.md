# IDMS

**Bayesian inference for SARS-CoV-2 transmission modelling, using Stan**

## About

Recode IDMS is a exemplar is to demonstrate how to design and fit a mathematical model of disease transmission to real data, in order to estimate key epidemiological parameters and inform public health responses, developed by [Bethan Cracknell Daniels](https://github.com/bnc19/).
