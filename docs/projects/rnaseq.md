# RNA Sequencing

**a pipeline for processing large volumes of biological data**

## About

This project demonstrates the development of a pipeline for processing RNA-seq datasets on the computing clusters, such as the Imperial College Research Computing Service (RCS), and basic statistical analysis of the normalised data. It is developed by Jack Gisby.
