Browse through the [Exemplars](exemplars/index.md) section to find a project that you would like to study. You can also use the Search bar or [Topics](tags.md) section to look for projects that use specific languages, tools or scientfic concepts (such as "R", "Object Oriented Programming" or "RNA sequencing").


You can interact with each exemplar through its GitHub repository or through a website (built using [Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) or [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)). Each approach has its own merits. Interacting with an exemplar via its GitHub site gets you closer to the underlying code and teaches you how to organise a project. Using the website provides a clean environment to study the documentation.


Do not forget to run the code as well, each exemplar runs locally and many have High Performance Computing cluster instructions that you can try on the [Imperial cluster](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/).


Happy Computing!
