Browse through the "Exemplars" section to find a project that you woudl like to study. You can also use the Search bar or "Topics" section to look for projects that use the language/tools/scientfic concept (such as "R" "Object Oriented Programming" or "RNA sequencing"),


You can interact with each exemplar through its GitHub repository or through a rendered system of webpages (using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) or [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)). Each approach has its own merit. GitHub is closer to the underlying code and teaches you how to organise a project. The rendered webpages provide a clean environment to study all README files.


Do not forget to run the code as well, each exemplar runs locally and many have high performance computing (HPC) cluster instructions that you can try on the [Imperial cluster](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/).


Happy Computing!
